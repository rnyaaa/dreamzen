# game engine

Attempting to create a PS1 style game engine (Gouraud lighting, low polygon counts, limitations, etc..) 

This is then going to be used for an RTS or a blatant LSD Dream Emulator ripoff or whatever else would make sense at that point.

## To-do

 1. Figure out what sort of features this engine would have - it would need to be true-ish to the limitations of ps1.
 2. Program that stuff, starting with the tests on the lowest level requirements at the math-level
 3. Everything else lol

## Neat ideas

## Endless RTS/Sandbox???
  So the game would be an orthographically projected builder in the style of RTS but the map keeps expanding. The starting chunk has all you need for the start, low threat etc, but       once that runs out you need to expand outward either because of (debatable: food shortage, room shortage, pollution, etc...). For the neat endgame stuff you need to travel to           badlands.
  The map would probably be incredibly large and the further you go the weirder it gets. It would maybe have a limit in a large obsidian wall on the far reaches. 
  
  Maybe in the cardinal directions you get different kinds of badlands. Like frost evil to the south, lava pool evil to the north, void glitch matrix evil in the east and biological      mass hivemind evil to the west. In the very middle is idyllic forests, further out one level you get some mildly bad empires. One more out and you get deserts, swamps, some evil        creatures, more evil empires. Then it slowly turns into the aforementioned badlands.


### Fog
  Like have everything else very ps1 low grade stuff but have really fancy fog in it. 
  I like it to be scary and that seems like a good feature that would totally up the weirdness factor.
  
### Sounds behaving in space
  I like the idea of modelling the way sound bounces in environments. Find a way to work that into the engine.

### Gouraud lighting
  It looks so crappy in a very PS1 style way. Figure out how to implement that while still having fancy fog.

### OBJ file compatibility
  I want to be able to model objects in blender and then import it into the game.

### Use the ENTT handling system when starting to implement entities
### Parallax ps1 handling
  JÃ¶kull said this was neat
