Attempting to create a PS1 style game engine (Gouraud lighting, low polygon counts, limitations, etc..) 

This is then going to be used for an RTS or a blatant LSD Dream Emulator ripoff or whatever else would make sense at that point.

## To-do

 1. Figure out what sort of features this engine would have - it would need to be true-ish to the limitations of ps1.
 2. Program that stuff, starting with the tests on the lowest level requirements at the math-level
 3. Everything else lol

## Neat ideas

### Fog
  Like have everything else very ps1 low grade stuff but have really fancy fog in it. 
  I like it to be scary and that seems like a good feature that would totally up the weirdness factor.
  
### Sounds behaving in space
  I like the idea of modelling the way sound bounces in environments. Find a way to work that into the engine.

### Gouraud lighting
  It looks so crappy in a very PS1 style way. Figure out how to implement that while still having fancy fog.

### OBJ file compatibility
  I want to be able to model objects in blender and then import it into the game.

### Parallax ps1 handling
  JÃ¶kull said this was neat
